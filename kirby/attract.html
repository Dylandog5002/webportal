	    <h1 style="font-size: 2.5em">Dylan's Dangerous maze</h1>
	    <img src="images/maze.png" alt="maze" width="30%">
	    <p>Deep within the dark woods lays an old, abandoned house. Its walls are stained with the years of neglect and the broken windows show the remains of furniture that was long ago forgotten. As you approach the house, a chill runs down your spine and the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end. You can feel an eerie presence lurking in the shadows, waiting to surprise you at any moment.</p>
		<br>
		<p>You take a deep breath and step inside, only to find yourself in a long, winding maze. The walls are barely lit, and the only sound is your own breathing. You take a few hesitant steps forward, and as you do, the walls start to close in, trapping you inside. You frantically search for a way out, but the further you walk, the more complicated the maze becomes.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Suddenly, you hear a strange noise coming from behind you. You spin around, only to see a large, menacing figure standing directly in your path. You stand still, unsure of what to do. You want to scream for help, but the figure stares you down, daring you to make a move. You have no choice but to continue on and hope you can find your way out before it's too late.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Your heart races as you make your way through the maze, desperately searching for the exit. The walls are closing in on you, and you can feel the fear building up inside. You make one last turn and the exit suddenly appears in front of you. You take one last look at the figure and then you run. You don't look back, you just keep running until you reach safety.</p>
	
	
	
	    <h1 style="font-size: 2.5em">Carsten's creepy castillo</h1>
	    <img src="images/castle.png" alt="castle" width="30%">
	    <p>Deep in the heart of the forest, a castle looms in the darkness. Its crumbling walls and broken towers tell a story of a forgotten past. The moonlight casts eerie shadows on the walls, and the wind whistles through the windows, creating an atmosphere of dread. The stones beneath your feet seem to whisper secrets, and the creaking of the old door as it slowly opens is enough to make your heart stop. Inside, the castle is cold and damp, with cobwebbed corners and dusty corridors. The air is heavy with a musty smell, and the walls are lined with tapestries that are darkened with age. You can almost feel the presence of something sinister lurking in the shadows. You can hear strange noises from within, and you are certain you can feel eyes watching you from the darkness. You are alone in this place, and you can only imagine the horrors that lie within.</p>
